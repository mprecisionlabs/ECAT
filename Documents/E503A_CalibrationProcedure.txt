1.  This document should be used as the basis for creating the new document
    "90-503-009-01-A E503A Calibration Work Instruction".

2.  All external references are to the document
    "90-503-009-00-A E503 Calibration Verification Work Instruction", hereafter
    referred to as "E503-CAL", which at the time of this writing is located in
    directory "\\uswil-speng01\17025\Laboratory-Management-System\Procedures and
    Work Instructions\17025 & NIST Calibration Procedures".

3.  The following steps must be performed in the specified order.
    If it is necessary to repeat an earlier step, then all steps following the
    repeated step must also be repeated in the same order.

4.  If significant adjustments are required for any step (particularly to
    hardware for short circuit current or waveform timing), it may be necessary
    to repeat some or all of the previous steps.

5.  Complete the E503-CAL as far as Step #1.

6.  Adjust the following to within the specified tolerances at both 500 V
    and 6000 V, IN THE SPECIFIED ORDER
    - note that the "L1/PE" mode indicates the "LINE Coupler" calibration adjustment,
        and "FP" indicates the "Front Panel" adjustment
    - SCI is "Short Circuit Current"
    - this can be done via the ECAT front panel, or with EvaluWave

        Waveform    Mode    Adjustment  Refer to this step in E503-CAL
        --------    ----    ----------  ------------------------------
        500 A       L1/PE   Voltage     Step #1 "Calibration Constants"
        500 A       L1/PE   Waveform    Step #2 "Risetimes"

        500 A       FP      SCI         Step #3 "SCI"

        200 A       FP      Voltage     Step #1 "Calibration Constants"
        200 A       FP      Waveform    Step #2 "Risetimes"
        200 A       FP      SCI         Step #3 "SCI"

7.  The remaining calibration adjustments require either EvaluWave or SurgeWare
    to enter and store the calibration data to the E503A module.

8.  Set the four baseline calibration values for Negative Front Panel and
    Negative Line Coupler to their corresponding Positive Cal Values.  That is,
    set 200 A Front Panel Negative to the same value as 200 A Front Panel
    Positive, etc.

        For EvaluWave:
            Set "Front Panel (WF 0; negative)" to the value in "Front Panel (WF 0)"
            Set "Line Coupler (WF 0; negative)" to the value of "Line Coupler (WF 0)"
            Set "Front Panel (WF 1; negative)" to the value of "Front Panel (WF 1)"
            Set "Line Coupler (WF 1; negative)" to the value of "Line Coupler (WF 1)"
        
        For SurgeWare:
            Set CAL[18] to the value at CAL[3] (200 A, Front Panel)
            Set CAL[19] to the value at CAL[4] (200 A, Line Coupler)
            Set CAL[20] to the value at CAL[5] (500 A, Front Panel)
            Set CAL[21] to the value at CAL[6] (500 A, Line Coupler)

11. Adjust the following NEGATIVE voltage outputs to within the specified
    tolerances at both 500 V and 6000 V
    - refer to E503-CAL Step #1 "Calibration Constants"
    - note that the adjustment voltages are entered as POSITIVE values,
        just like the Positive calibration adjustment values

        Waveform  Mode    EvaluWave table entry       SurgeWare CAL table index
        --------  ----    ---------------------       -------------------------
        200 A     FP      Front Panel (WF 0; negative)  18
        200 A     L1/PE   Line Coupler (WF 0; negative) 19
        500 A     FP      Front Panel (WF 1; negative)  20
        500 A     L1/PE   Line Coupler (WF 1; negative) 21

12. For both the 200A and 500A waveforms, set Coupling Mode to L1-L2/PE
    (Two Lines to Ground) and measure voltage at 6000V.  Enter the error in the
    appropriate table location:

        Waveform  Mode    EvaluWave table entry       SurgeWare CAL table index
        --------  ----    ---------------------       -------------------------
        200 A     L1-L2/PE  Two Lines -> PE (WF0)       22 (as TENTHS OF PERCENT)
        500 A     L1-L2/PE  Two Lines -> PE (WF1)       24 (as TENTHS OF PERCENT)

    - iteratively adjust as required
    - error calculation example for measured voltage of 5650 V:
                6000 - 5650
        Error = ----------- = 0.058 = 5.8%
                   6000
    - most errors will be positive percentage values (to boost the voltage)
    - for SurgeWare ONLY:
        - 5.8% is 58 'tenths of a percent', so enter '58' into the CAL table
        - negative error values are entered as (65536 - value), so -5.8%
            would be (65536 - 58) = '65478'
    
13. For both the 200A and 500A waveforms, set Coupling Mode to L1/L2
    (One Line to Line) and measure voltage at 6000V.  Enter the error in the
    appropriate table location:
    
        Waveform  Mode    EvaluWave table entry       SurgeWare CAL table index
        --------  ----    ---------------------       -------------------------
        200 A     L1/L2   Line -> Line (WF 0)           23 (as TENTHS OF PERCENT)
        500 A     L1/L2   Line -> Line (WF 1)           25 (as TENTHS OF PERCENT)

    - iteratively adjust as required
    - refer to previous step (Two Lines to Ground) for error calculation
        and data entry instructions

14.  Complete E503-CAL Step #4, "Line Sync Calibration"

15. Verify calibration settings at all specified voltage and coupling mode
    combinations using EvaluWave
    - ref Steps #5 and #7 in E503-CAL (there is NO Step #6!)
    
16. The Addendum in E503-CAL is also valid for E503A.

17. The following "E503A Supplemental CAL Table Reference" specifically refers
    to the locations in the SurgeWare CAL table that the E503A supplemental
    calibration adjustments are located, which correlates with their placement
    in the E503A module serial EEPROM.
