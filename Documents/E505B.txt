E505B Relay Control
-------------------
The E505B is very similar in function to the E505A, except that it has a built-in coupler/decoupler (CDN) for the 2.5 kV waveform and some of the relay functions have been changed.  For the E505B:

         |--------- Output ----------|
         |        Built-in   External|
Waveform |Direct  CDN        CDN     |
-------- |------  --------   --------|
800 V     Yes     No         No
1500 V    Yes     No         No
2500 V    No      Yes        No

Relay functions are also different between the E505B and the E505A.  Following is the comprehensive list of relays used in the E505B module:
